# MXEN4004
Hi!
This is GitHub storage for my MXEN4004 project.
It contains the implementations and testing data relevant to the 
* Python speech recognition modules testing
* Live Whisper speech recogition testing and implementation (please note the laptop implementation was inspired by  https://github.com/austin-bev/LiveWhisperGUI and https://github.com/Nikorasu/LiveWhisper with adaptions made by me to make it suitable for the ROS MiRo functionality)
* Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) activities implementation and performance (GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 and implementation with speech recognition)
* Other resources (including other tests and a resource for CST activities)

Relevant Results for the CST activities can be found here:
